# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository (`saykai-examples`) contains **non-executable reference materials** only. It does not include production Saykai code, deployable services, or customer environments.

If you believe you have found a security issue affecting the Saykai product or any Saykai-operated systems, please report it using the guidance below.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately.

Include, if possible:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a minimal proof of concept)
- Any relevant screenshots, logs, or URLs
- Your assessment of severity (low, medium, high, critical)

Please avoid posting details publicly until we have had a chance to investigate.

## Where to report

Email: security@saykai.com

If email is not feasible, use a private channel you already have with the Saykai team.

## What to expect

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days
- Provide a status update once the issue is triaged
- Work with you on a reasonable disclosure timeline

## Out of scope

The following are generally out of scope for this repository:
- Issues in third-party services or dependencies not controlled by Saykai
- Denial of service reports against public endpoints (this repo has none)
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical security

## Safe harbor

We welcome good-faith security research. If you act in good faith, avoid privacy violations, and do not disrupt services, we will not pursue legal action for your research.
